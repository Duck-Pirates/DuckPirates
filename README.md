**Duck Pirates** is a game being developed by a team of university students from **The University of York** as part of a project.

The aim of this project is to create a pirate game based on our university's campus that has been flooded and is now plagued with pirates.

During the game you will play as one of these pirate vessels with your allegiance tied to one of the 10 colleges of the university.
Your objective it to destroy the other colleges and steal their plunder whiles overcoming other obstacles such as bad weather, monsters and enemy ships.
Will you be able to overcome the waves of York to become the one true pirate king?

We will be updating our <a href="https://duck-pirates.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a> with our journey through the design and conceptualization process.

Stay tuned for more!

**Team 19**
